HWebUI
======

Haskell User Interface Library

Early prototype.

Installation
============

Download sources with git, enter directory on command line prompt and type:

~~~
cabal install
~~~

This installs HWebUI with all its dependencies and also the
HWebUI-example1 executable.

If you don't want to change your Haskell environment, consider
replacing `cabal` by `cabal-dev` for a sandboxed install. See
[hackage/cabal-dev](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-dev).

Demo
====

Run HWebUI-example-arithmetic, HWebUI-example-currency, HWebUI-example-counter or HWebUI-example-multiselect and point your browser to:

http://localhost:8080/webgui
